                The SkyCable refund project allows subscribers to reclaim overpayments for cable services conveniently through either Maya or GCash. To initiate the refund process, subscribers must verify their accounts via a one-time password (OTP) sent to their registered Sky email or mobile number. This verification step ensures the security and accuracy of the refund process.

                The project aligns with the recent PLDT and Sky agreement to terminate cable services, providing an essential service for customers looking to retrieve their funds. By offering multiple payment options, it caters to a broad audience, ensuring a seamless experience. Subscribers are encouraged to keep their contact details updated to avoid any delays in the refund process.

              <p>This initiative not only aims to enhance customer satisfaction but also reinforces Sky's commitment to transparency and customer care during this transition. As subscribers delve into the refund process, they can rest assured that their claims will be processed efficiently, enabling them to receive their refunds swiftly. Ultimately, this project represents a step towards resolving outstanding financial matters as cable services conclude.</p>
